## Deployment

Thid project is deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku. 
    -- steps for deployment 
     - All dependencies were placed in the `requirements.txt` file
     - fork or clone 
     - the buildpacks were set to python and NodeJS
     - two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab with the ordering 
1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs` were created
      -  a _Config Var_ called `PORT` with Set this to `8000` wrer created 
            . Link the Heroku app to the repository
            . click on deploy
    
Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.
